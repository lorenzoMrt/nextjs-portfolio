        ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My names Lorenzo. As a seasoned full stack developer with over 4
        years of experience, I have honed my skills in Java, Springboot, React,
        TypeScript and AWS services. My work in startups and medium companies
        has provided me with a diverse range of experience and the ability to
        work effectively in fast-paced environments. I am a self-starter with a
        passion for developing scalable and efficient solutions, and I am eager
        to bring my expertise to a new challenge as a full stack developer.
        <br /> Lets connect ðŸ‘‡
